# NumPy - Comprehensive Guide and Exercises

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive guide to **NumPy**, a powerful library for numerical computing in Python. It covers all essential concepts, from basic array manipulation to advanced techniques, with plenty of hands-on examples and exercises.

### Topics Covered
1. **Introduction to NumPy**  
   - Basic operations with NumPy arrays  
   - NumPy vs Python lists  
   - Creating NumPy arrays: `np.array()`, `np.arange()`, `np.linspace()`, etc.
  
2. **Array Indexing and Slicing**  
   - Accessing elements and modifying arrays  
   - Slicing arrays  
   - Multidimensional arrays (2D, 3D) and slicing

3. **Advanced Indexing and Boolean Masking**  
   - Fancy indexing with integer arrays  
   - Boolean masking for conditional indexing  
   - Using `np.ix_` for cross-product indexing

4. **Mathematical Operations**  
   - Element-wise arithmetic operations  
   - Matrix multiplication and dot products  
   - Linear algebra operations (e.g., `np.dot()`, `np.linalg`)

5. **Statistical Operations**  
   - Calculating mean, median, standard deviation  
   - Variance and correlation  
   - Random number generation and distributions

6. **Reshaping and Combining Arrays**  
   - `reshape()`, `vstack()`, `hstack()`  
   - Transpose and flatten arrays

7. **File I/O with NumPy**  
   - Loading data with `np.loadtxt()` and `np.genfromtxt()`  
   - Saving arrays using `np.savetxt()`  
   - Handling missing values in datasets
